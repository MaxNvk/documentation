# Managing a release

Adding entries to a [release](/user-docs/releases/introduction) allow viewing them altogether on a single page.

From a release page, you can:

- edit the name of the release, or delete the release,
- [adjust the view](#choose-how-entries-are-grouped) to display entries grouped either by locale or by content-type,
- decide whether an entry will be [published or unpublished](#publish-or-unpublish-entries) with the release,
- edit a specific entry or [remove](#remove-entries-from-a-release) it from the release,
- and publish the release.

## Choose how entries are grouped

A release page can display entries either grouped by locales or by content-type. To change how entries are grouped, click the **Group by …** dropdown and select an option from the list.

<!-- TODO: add screenshot? -->

## Publish or unpublish entries

A release includes multiple entries. You can set the state of each entry with the **Publish** and **Unpublish** action buttons. When the release itself is “published” then the desired actions are simultaneously performed on each entry.

:::caution
Once a release is published, the release itself cannot be updated. You can not re-release that specific release with the same group of entries with some modifications; you must create another release.

## Remove entries from a release

<!-- TODO: double-check icon and button name -->
Entries can be removed from a release. To do so, click the three dots **…** at the end of the line of an entry and select the **Remove from release** button.
