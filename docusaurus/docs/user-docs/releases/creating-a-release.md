# Creating a release

The [Releases](/user-docs/releases/introduction) page allows creating new releases that will be used to group content-types.

  }}
/>

To create a new release:

1. Click the **+ New release** button in the upper right corner of the Releases page.  
2. Give the release a name.
3. Click the **Continue** button.

The release is created and you can start adding content types to it (see [Managing a release](/user-docs/releases/managing-a-release)).
